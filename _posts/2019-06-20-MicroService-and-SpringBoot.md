### Micro Service
>Micro Service is an architecture that allows the developers to `develop and deploy services independently`. Each service running has its `own process` and this achieves the `lightweight model` to support large business applications.

### Spring Boot
>Spring Boot provides a platform for Java developers to develop a `stand-alone` and `production-grade` spring application that you can **just run**. You can get started with `minimum configurations` without the need for an entire Spring configuration setup.

### Spring Boot Features
- Provides a `flexible way` to `configure` `Java Beans`, `XML` configurations, and `Database Transactions`
- Provides a `powerful batch processing` and manages `REST endpoints`
- Almost everything is `auto configured`
- Offers `annotation-based` spring application
- Eases `dependency management`
- Includes Embedded `Servlet Container`
