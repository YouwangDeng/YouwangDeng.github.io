### Java JSP
- **Java Server Pages**
- A `server side` technology
- Used to create **dynamic web content**
- `Tags` are used to insert `JAVA` code into `HTML` pages
-  An advanced version of Servlet Technology, `Extension to Servlet`, it has all features of servlets, implicit objects and custom tags
- JSP is first **converted into servlet** by JSP container before processing the clientâ€™s request

### Difference between Servlet and JSP
- Servlet
    >A Servlet is a `Java class` which is used to `extend` the capabilities of `servers` that host applications accessed by means of a request-response model. Servlets can respond to `other types of requests too`.
- JSP
    >A JSP is a `text document` which contains `two types` of text: `static data` and `dynamic data`. The static data can be expressed in any `text-based format` (like HTML, XML, SVG and WML), and the dynamic content can be expressed by `JSP elements`.
