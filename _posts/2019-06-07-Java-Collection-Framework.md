### [The Collections Framework](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/collections/index.html)
* A collection — sometimes called a **container** — is simply an object that groups multiple elements into a single unit. Collections are used to **store, retrieve, manipulate, and communicate aggregate data**. 
* a unified architecture for representing and manipulating collections, enabling them to be **manipulated independently** of the **details** of their representation
* Content
    * **Interfaces**
        >These are **abstract data types** that represent collections. Interfaces allow collections to be manipulated independently of the details of their representation. In **object-oriented** languages, interfaces generally **form a hierarchy**.
    * **Implementations** 
        >These are the **concrete implementations** of the collection interfaces. In essence, they are reusable data structures.
    * **Algorithms**
        >These are the methods that perform useful computations, such as **searching and sorting**, on objects that implement collection interfaces
* Interface Hierachy
