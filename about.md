I'm Youwang, a CS graduate student at USC and also a huge fun of technologies that improve people's daily life. 

I'd like to utilize what I have learned to solve practical problems, such as building an application to find nearby free delivery and nice condition furniture after moving house, or analyzing top 10 trendy tech jobs with data mining. I enjoy doing these projects because they are interesting and could make a difference in my real life.

I'm focused on software engineering, both front-end and back-end, I also pay attention to the quickly evolving technologies, make sure to choose the right tool for working.

Team mindset is the most important thing that I’ve learned from my software engineer intern experience. On the one hand, tasks are involved with many roles, such as product manager, UI designer, software developer, and tester. On the other hand, tasks have dependencies, the milestone of project won’t be achieved without team collaboration.

In addition, I am a positive and friendly man, enjoy work and life is my motto.
